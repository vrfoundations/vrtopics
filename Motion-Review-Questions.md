### What is apparent motion?

### The pattern of apparent motion of objects is called _____ .
Hint: Pick one of the following: Optical flow, vection, smearing, field of view.

### What is vection?

Vection is ____ .
involuntary change in field of view, voluntary head rotations, the illusion of self-motion

Vection is observed as a visual cue that includes 
judder, jumping, smearing or smudging of the visual field

### Why does the brain suppresses perception of motion during saccades?

### Why can you see eye movement in a selfie-camera but not in mirror?


### True/False? In a large field of view with movement the brain interprets that you are moving and the scene is stationary.

### Which of the following do NOT affect vection?

* Percentage of field of view 
* Distance from center view
* Exposure time
* Spatial frequency 
* Contrast. 
* Other cues 
* Prior knowledge. Expecting motion change in the future (e.g. moving stearing wheel)
* Attention
* Adapatation

### True/False? The visual cues of of wind blowing and sounds of objects passing can dimish vection?

### hich of the following is NOT a sympton of VR sickness?
* Fatigue, Headache, Nausea, Dizziness, Cromulence, Drowsiness, Eyestreain, Increased Salivation, 

What is Sensory Conflict Theory?

### Developer recommendations
Which one of the following correctly describe developer recommendations to reduce VR sickness?

* Reduce brightness and contrast at edge of tracked zone.
* Avoid use of an avatar when possible.
* Reduce real-world motion to prevent gorilla arms
* Add 180 spin turn-around options
* UI elements should float in front of the users point of view
* Virtual nose can help with nauesa
* Increse opportunities of locomotion?
* Avoid movement of objects in most of the visual field e.g. occlude parts ot the scene.

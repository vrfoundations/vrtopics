Which is a potential comfort-related benefit of using a third-person camera instead of a first-person one for a flight simulator?
    a) The field of view is not obstructed by a large cockpit.

    c) The user can more clearly observe the environment and recognize important features.
    d) The camera can "decouple" from the plane, or not move/rotate with the plane.

True or False? One likely benefit of event-based programming is eliminating long series of "if" and "elseif" statements.
